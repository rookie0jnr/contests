ssh leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223 -l leviathan1


leviathan 0 -> leviathan 1
grep "leviathan" .backup/bookmarks.html

leviathan 1 -> leviathan 2
ltrace ./check
look for the {strcmp("xxx", "sex")} value!
It seems that "sex" is the password.
Once we use this password we get a shell with leviathan2 user
and simply cat the password file for leviathan2:
cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
NsN1HwFoyN

leviathan 2 -> leviathan3
